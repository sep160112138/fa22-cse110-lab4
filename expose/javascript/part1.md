1. The output is "values added: 20"
2. The output is "final result: 20"
3. The output is "values added: 20"
4. This line produces an error because in line 5, the 'result' variable is declared using 'let' in the if statement scope (lines 4-10), so the scope of the 'result' is only within that block. Line 13 is out of that scope so it cannot access 'result' and there's no other 'result' variable declared, so line 13 produces an error.
5. The code produces an error because 'result' is declared as a constant and initialized to be equal to 0. Line 7 attempts to change the value of 'result' which produces an error. So line 9 won't print anything.
